        <h1>Post letter boxes: position, violation, peculiar uses</h1>
        <div class="primary">
          <p>
            A remarkable case was that of a servant who was a somnambulist, and
            who for some time wrote letters in her sleep, night after night, and
            took them to adjacent letter boxes to post. Sometimes she was fully
            attired, and at other times only partially so. As a rule, the
            letters were properly addressed, but the girl did not always place
            postage stamps upon them.
          </p>

          <p>
            Occasionally the postmen have to encounter the difficulties arising
            from a frost-bound letter box. Such a case occurred with a box
            situated on the summit of the Mendip Hills. The letter box and the
            wall in which the box is built were found by the postman to be
            covered with ice, caused by rain and snow having frozen on them. The
            door resisted all his efforts to open it, and he had to leave it for
            the night. On making another effort when morning came, it taxed his
            ingenuity and that of other interested and willing helpers to get
            the box open. Hot water was tried, paraffin was poured into the
            lock, and it was only after a hammer had been used and a fire in a
            movable grate had been applied for a time that the lid could be
            opened.
          </p>

          <p>
            A letter box erected in a brick pillar in a secluded spot on the
            East Harptree road, about a mile distant from any habitation, was,
            late one night, damaged to the extent of having its iron door
            completely smashed off, apparently either by means of a large stone
            which lay at its base when the violation was discovered, or by means
            of a hammer and jemmy. Although the adjacent ground, ditches, and
            hedges were searched, no trace of the iron door could be found. As
            three roysterers were known to have passed the box on the night in
            question, it was assumed that the damage was done by them out of
            pure mischief and not from any desire to rob Her Majesty's mails.
            Whether such were the case or not, they had the unpleasant
            experience of being locked up over the Sunday on suspicion.

            The three hundred and fifty pillar and wall letter boxes are placed
            at convenient points, regard being had to the wants of the immediate
            neighbourhood that each has to serve—to approach by paved crossings,
            to contiguity to a public lamp, to being out of the way of
            pedestrians and as far removed from mud-splashing as possible. At
            the same time, the inspectors endeavour to place the boxes so that
            they may be an attraction, rather than an eyesore, to the spot where
            erected.
